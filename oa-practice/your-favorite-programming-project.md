# Tell us about your favorite programming project
My favorite programming project so far is a lesson that I prepared for my
students earlier this year. The 2 day exercise introduces students to Object
Oriented Programming in JavaScript by practicing pseudoclassical and ES6
instantiation and polymorphism. The task has students exploring a code-base with
that uses jQuery to display simple animations in their browser. Their assignment
is to create subclasses from a superclass where they must demonstrate their
command of the notoriously complicated `this` keyword. 

Though it may not use the fanciest of technologies, I love this exercise because
of the joy students have when they reach their "aha!" moments. Their journey
from frustration at the intentionally large and confusing code-base to the
moment when it "clicks" for them is magnificent.
