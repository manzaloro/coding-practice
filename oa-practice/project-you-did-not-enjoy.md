There are definitely projects that I enjoy less than others. The following is an
anecdote from my musical background but the takeaway is just as applicable for
software engineering.

I played in the Schleswig Holstein Music Festival Orchestra in Germany in 2012,
an international symphony made up of some of the best musicians in the world. We
performed Austrian composer Anton Bruckner's 7th Symphony. At first, I was
extremely hesitant; the music seemed heavy, slow, ponderous, and repetitive.
However, after spending time with the music and performing the piece a number of
times, it became one of my favorite works of all time. It turned out that many
of the aspects I originally disliked were actually strengths of the piece and
the composer that set it apart from other music.

What I learned from this experience is to give things in life a chance, whether
it is new music, a new technology or framework, or a new coworker. I often find
that if I am initially not fond of something I need to learn more and be
receptive to that new experience.
