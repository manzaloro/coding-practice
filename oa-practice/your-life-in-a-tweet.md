### Ideas
I'm a software engineer, former orchestral cellist, working remote. Love
collaboration and pair programming. Love learning new technologies. Life long learner.
I'm a teacher, so I know code really well and use mentoring and empathy skills
daily.
I'm detail oriented and also acutely aware of the big picture. I love my family
and am a dog person. Love movies.

### Draft
Software Engineer whose detail-oriented yet big-picture passion for taking
action, learning, practicing, collaborating, and mentoring stems from my 25 year
experiences as an orchestral cellist and private instructor. Jazzed about
coding, classical music, hiking, movies, and dogs.
